# Google Maps and APi
In order to implement the Google Maps lesson, we need a Google Maps Api Key. You could get your own, however, to speed up the process we will use mine. Please do not share or use in production - this is just for teaching purposes.

```js
const googleApiKey = 'AIzaSyBJptE3Te02Kozh8bqpBwaeA7hc3onQmBY';

const coords = {
    lat: 34.134617, 
    lng: -118.019816
}
```
